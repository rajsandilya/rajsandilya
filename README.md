## Hi there 👋

<!--
**rajsandilya/rajsandilya** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- Technical Lead Manager and Software/Solutions Architect with 25+ years of experience building large‑scale systems.
- Specialized in backend architecture, distributed systems, and cloud‑native development.
- Open to collaborating with teams working on open‑source projects in Java or Python.
- By night, I switch hats and dive into data science through Kaggle challenges.
